🫀 CardioRisk Pro
AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System
CardioRisk Pro is a high-performance web application designed for healthcare professionals to assess patient cardiovascular health. Using a Random Forest Machine Learning model, the system analyzes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data to predict the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
